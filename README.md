#Title: SQL Practice Projects â€“ My 30-Day MySQL Journey

#Introduction: This repository showcases my hands-on experience with MySQL. Over 30 days, I worked with three datasets, applying SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and solve real-world problems.

#Contents:
ðŸ“Š Dataset 1: (e.g., Sales Data) â€“ Aggregation & Filtering Queries
ðŸ§¾ Dataset 2: (e.g., Employee Data) â€“ Joins & Subqueries
ðŸ“ˆ Dataset 3: (e.g., Customer Data) â€“ Data Cleaning & Analysis

#Skills Demonstrated:
1.SQL Query Writing (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
2.Complex Joins & Subqueries
3.Data Aggregation (GROUP BY, HAVING)
4.Data Cleaning Techniques

#You can also practise this by:
Clone the repository and run the queries on your MySQL environment.
